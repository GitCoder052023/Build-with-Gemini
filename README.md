# Setup and Installation of Gemini

# Setting up API KEY
 

To use the API, we have to first get an API key that you can can from here: https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/setup

After that click on “Get an API key” button and then click on “Create API key in new project”.

Copy the API key and set it as an environment variable. We are using Deepnote and it is quite easy for us to set the key with the name you want. Just go to the integration, scroll down and select environment variables.

# Dependencies of Gemini
To use these scripts, you will need to install the following dependencies:

pathlib
textwrap
google.generativeai
IPython.display
PIL.Image
cv2
pyttsx3

Now, to install the required modules, you can use this following pip command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
pip install google-generativeai pyttsx3 opencv-python
```

You will also need to configure the Google Generative AI models with your API key. And you will will need to install "Python 3.10" to use Gemini.

# follow these steps to clone Gemini:
