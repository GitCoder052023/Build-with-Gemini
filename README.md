# Setup and Installation of Gemini

# Setting up API KEY
 

To use the API, we have to first get an API key that you can can from here: https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/setup

After that click on “Get an API key” button and then click on “Create API key in new project”.

Copy the API key and set it as an environment variable. We are using Deepnote and it is quite easy for us to set the key with the name you want. Just go to the integration, scroll down and select environment variables.
